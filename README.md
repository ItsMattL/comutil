# comutil

The `comutil` library provides additional API and type support for interacting
with the component object model runtime in Windows, beyond that which is
supplied by the [go-ole library](https://github.com/go-ole).

In particular, this library enables the creation of COM instances that
communicate directly with remote servers.

This library is a work in progress. The API it provides is liable to be
modified as additional features are added. It is possible that it may someday be
merged into go-ole or into another library if it seems appropriate.
